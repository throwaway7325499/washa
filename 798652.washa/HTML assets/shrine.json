The main reason for that is <strong>time</strong>. As much I love making the big cinematic scenes, they are pretty much a string of scenes, all connected and it isn't something simply to achieve in the animation, as all the movements must have a continuous flow. On top of that, I'm not really happy to have only one pose and keep milking it for a 2-3 minutes long scenes, with the same pose but with some speed variations. Another thing that I'll be dropping is the early access content, mostly because I'd to deal with two kind of releases, one for the early access and another for the public one. By having only one release, it saves me some good amount of time, and you guys keep receiving it ahead of time anyway :)</p><p>With that said, the biggest point of this change of course is to allow myself to make more animations and other things, like <strong>games</strong>! I know you all loved the Sonia project and I want to keep expanding that part of the universe, exploring new ways to interact and keep you guys aroused \ud83d\ude0f</p><p>Hope you guys can understand this changes and get excited for the new stuff we're planning to do, specially on the games parts :D</p><p>Thanks for reading this, you're awesome!<br />Much love, washa \u2764\ufe0f</p>"]], "media": []}, "40461586": {"utc": "2020-08-14 20:01:01", "title": "Modeus (Helltaker) - Public SD Release", "file": {"name": "40461586.public_release.jpg", "edited": "20200814"}, "body": [["<p>Hello everyone!

I decided to pick a very old picture that Shadman and I made together and was meant to be animated, I can't really link it as it contains beast stuff, and as Patreon doesn't like this kind of stuff, I'll just leave a hint how to get into it (Tifa X Nanaki).<br />As I couldn't use Nanaki for TOS reasons, I was trying really hard to swap Nanaki with Cloud, but as this was an old drawing and by the time Shad did it, the perspective and character's anatomy wasn't very right, so it turned out pretty much impossible to add Cloud on the scene haha.</p><p>I was fucked up, couldn't draw Cloud, couldn't fix Tifa, couldn't do anything haha, then I was taking advice's from Sunsetnivaris (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SunsetNiva\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/SunsetNiva/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a> go check her stuff, it's really good!), she enlighten me with some magical trick: 3D Models right inside Clip Studio Paint.

What it means? It means that for every second, I've to work around 24 frames. It gives the animation a super smooth looking, that's also the the film industry standard workflow.<br />As you guys has been following this project and noticed that it's taking a very long to make it, mostly due the complexity of the rig, that makes the whole process very slow as the After Effects have to keep processing a LOT of stuff under the hood.<br />So I decided to change the animation from 24 to 12 fps, it means I'll have only half of the frames to polish and render. So it should be done by the half of the time too :)</p><p>Now, I hear you technical lover screaming back there!<br /><em>- Dearest Mr. Washa, will the animation stop been super smooth as other were?<br /></em>Well my fellow companion, recently I'd the oportunity to work in a project that were made in 12fps, and it doens't makes a difference that big in the technical aspect, your eye will keep seeing the animation as normal, the animation will not be super smooth anymre, instead, just smooth. Mostly of the porn animations you watch are made in this way. Also, a good example of animations made in 12fps were the classic Looney Toons and Tom &amp; Jerry, it's more economic and still looks cool! :)</p><p>I haven't converted it yet, but I'll do it before start streaming on next friday. That's not the kind of thing you do during the project but before, so something will explode for sure lol</p><p>Hope you guys have a great week!

It was my lucky day! Because there were so close to where I was.<br />While I was walking in their direction, I felt the shiver mixed with a warm sensation in my body, it was so thrilling! I couldn't control my body anymore!<br />By the time I noticed, I was already in front of them and could see how strong and manly they were! (giggles) They had a wild look in their eyes! While staring at them, I could feel how receptives they were... (pause) Still! I wanted to offer some eggs I gathered and wish them a good journey!<br />(laugh) It was so funny how amazed they were with that big amount of eggs I was offerning. I was so happy!<br />Then I started telling them about my daily routine of petting and caring for the animals from our farm. I was telling them a lot of stuff, but nothing drew their attention more than when I told them about my <em>special</em> ability with milking...<br />I noticed that they looked to each other and it brought a smile in their faces. Right after that we exchanged some looks and I just felt that I should keep teasing them...

I finished a cool puppet, let's animate it!\". But for this rig my first thought when I finished was: \"ok, looks like I build an robot instead of an regular puppet!\" hahahaha seriouly! this puppet has tons of awesome features and is heavy to work with as an giant robot haha</p><p>Here's some cool features:</p><ul> <li>Head Turn: that's the first time I implement this kind of movement, it adds a lot to the animation and make the character feel more organic and natural, I really love how it turned out!</li> <li>Boobies Engine 2.0: as you guys saw on the previous wips, the boobies looks really organic and behave as a beloved boobie should be :)</li> <li>Partial body rotation: following the same principles of the Head and boobies, the body can turn around, divided by the hips, torso and neck</li> <li>Facial Expressions: The mouth has about 12 different states + 12 tongue states, the eyebrows have unique controllers so I can adjust and create any pose I want.</li> <li>Foreskin for the deaks: like on the Priscylla animation, I also add it on Link's deaks, as I think it make it more natural than deaks without it as they kind of look like an dildo :P</li></ul><p>These are the main features that came up, there a bunch of pretty boring stuff I added too, but nothing fancy or cool that you can tell to your family or friends lol</p><p>I'm also attaching/linking another cool quick-animation tests I did while making the final tweaks on the rig :)</p><p>head turn (HD): <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/GreenAppropriateBluegill\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://gfycat.com/GreenAppropriateBluegill</a></p><p>handjob: <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/ChubbySophisticatedDorking\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://gfycat.com/ChubbySophisticatedDorking</a></p><p>just a final word as it makes me feel great about it, thank everyone of you guys! this is only happening thanks for each of you!

Other projects were some how on going and I had the chance to add more stuff or tweak some parts of the animation to make it look even better.<br /></p><p>Now comes the other side of the coin, as other projects were some how on going and I'd enough time to polish the animation and delivery it as monthly reward, for this project that will not happen as I'll have to start it from scratch, usually an regular project takes about 2 up to 3 months to be complete, specially if it has more scenes and also a cumshot climax. The regular length of this animations is about 15 up to 30 seconds of animation, see? it's 30x24 frames, it's 720 frames of animation, it's pretty insane hahaha<br /></p><p>One option is to make similar to what I did with the last Ahri animation, where I fully polished the first scene and then released as a stand alone animation, it isn't the best option my workflow, as I just do the polish once I've all the poses and everything on the animation working, but who knows!</p><p>Alright, now let's dive right into the project! That's a picture done by Hizzy that she did a while ago, this one wasn't even released, so it's sort an exclusive picture, shouldn't we all few proud of this?! hahaha As you can see, this scene features our lovely Linkle jerking off two dudes (Links?) But this scene has more potential than that! The idea is to make a scene like this:</p><p>Jerk off Link A+B --&gt; Blow job Link A/Jerk B --&gt; Blow job Link B/Jerk A --&gt; Blow job A and B (?) --&gt; Link A/B Cum --&gt; Resting</p><p>This is just an idea, things might change once I start animating, haha</p><p>What do you guys think?
